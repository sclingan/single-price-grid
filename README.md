## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

Trying to focus on using Grid, still had to use flexbox for centering content.

### Continued development

I would like to return to this project and build out the backend.
